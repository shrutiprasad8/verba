Live Demo: https://verba-bice.vercel.app/ | GitHub Repository: https://github.com/shrutiprasad8/verba.git

A sleek, dark-themed interface for summarizing documents.

**📌 Overview**

Verba is a modern, AI-powered web application that transforms lengthy documents into concise, easy-to-read summaries. Built to fulfill a technical assessment, this project showcases a seamless user experience, from uploading a document to receiving an intelligent summary generated by Google's Gemini model. It handles both PDF and image files, making it a versatile tool for students, researchers, and professionals looking to quickly grasp the key points of any document.

**✨ Key Features**

📄 Multi-Format Upload: Simple drag-and-drop or file browser interface for uploading PDF and all standard image formats (PNG, JPG, etc.).

*🤖 Advanced Client-Side Text Extraction*:

PDF Parsing: Utilizes pdf.js to accurately extract text from multi-page PDFs directly in the browser.

*Image OCR/: Integrates Tesseract.js to perform high-quality Optical Character Recognition on scanned documents or images.

*🧠 AI-Powered Summarization*: Connects to the Google Gemini API to generate high-quality summaries, with options for short, medium, or long outputs.

*📱 Fully Responsive Design*: A sophisticated, dark-themed UI built with Tailwind CSS that provides a premium experience on any device.
